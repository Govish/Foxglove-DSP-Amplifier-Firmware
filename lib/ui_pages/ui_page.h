 * Quick utility class to make transitions between two UI pages convenient and explicit
 * Kinda experimenting with what I can do with C++ here, so hopefully all is working as expected here
 * Set up a from-->to style page transition, execute the transition by just invoking the instance
 * Class overrides the call operator `()` and will execute each page's `on_exit()` and `on_entry()` methods
 * 
 * NOTE: not confident enough in my C++ abilities to say how these will behave when `Pg_transitions` are stack allocated
 * Out of safety, always declare `Pg_transition`s as static, i.e. ensure global allocation
