 * static class to interact with MQS peripheral on the Teensy 4.1 as relevant to the Foxglove DSP Amplifier project
 * code heavily borrows from "output_mqs" in the Teensy audio library by PJRC
 * 
 * Modifications are made to the interface as well as some slight performance and ease-of-use improvements
 * At the cost of flexibility and portability
 * 
 * Effort is made to make the code as "C++-like" as possible, but I'm pretty new to
